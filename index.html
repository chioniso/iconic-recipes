        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> For meat, mix the beef mince with the meat sauce listed above. Marinate the meat for about 30 mins while you are working on other ingredients to enhance the flavour. Add some cooking oil into a wok and cook the meat on medium high to high heat. It takes about 3 to 5 mins to thoroughly cook it.<br>
        <strong>Step 2:</strong> Mix the Bibimbap sauce ingredients in a bowl.<br>
        <strong>Step 3:</strong> Put the rice into a bowl and add the meat, assorted vegetables, seasoned seaweed, Bibimbap sauce and the egg on top of the rice. Serve it.<br>
        <strong>Step 4:</strong> Mix the ingredients well in the bowl and enjoy!

 <p>
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Place the chicken in a large bowl. Sprinkle on top of the chicken: 2 teaspoon salt, garlic powder, and onion powder then toss to coat the chicken in the spices.<br> 
 <strong>Step 2:</strong> Add the buttermilk and hot sauce to bowl, stir until everything is combined. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in the fridge for at least 2 hours, but it’s best if you can let it sit overnight.<br>
 <strong>Step 3:</strong> In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, 2 teaspoon salt, paprika and black pepper. Set aside.<br>
 <strong>Step 4:</strong> Fill up a deep fryer (deep cast iron skillet or dutch oven) with peanut oil (or neutral frying oil of your choice) and preheat to 350°F.<br>
 <strong>Step 5:</strong> Taking the chicken pieces one at a time, let the excess buttermilk drip off. Coat in the flour mixture, make sure the chicken is well coated. Shake off any excess. Set the chicken aside and let it sit for a few minutes until the coating starts to look a little pasty.<br>
 <strong>Step 6:</strong> Carefully add the piece of chicken to the deep fryer and continue with the next piece. Don't add more than three or four pieces at at time. You will need to fry in batches so you do not overcrowd the fryer. Fry until golden brown, turning every few minutes.<br>
 <strong>Step 7:</strong> Chicken is done when golden brown and the internal temperature reaches 165°F. Depending on the size of the chicken, dark meat can take about 12-14 minutes and white meat takes 8-10 minutes (these are estimates - use a meat thermometer for accurate doneness)<br>
 <strong>Step 8:</strong> When the chicken is done frying, place it on a paper towel lined sheet tray and immediately sprinkle a little flaked salt on top. Continue with the rest of the chicken pieces.<br>

 <p>
   <strong>Step 1:</strong> For the coating whisk together 1/2 cup sugar and cinnamon in a shallow dish, set aside.<br>
   <strong>Step 2:</strong> Heat about 1 1/2 inches vegetable oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium-high heat to 360 degrees Fahrenheit. While oil is heating prepare batter.<br>
   <strong>Step 3:</strong> Add water, butter, sugar and salt to a large saucepan, bring to a boil over medium-high heat.<br>
   <strong>Step 4:</strong> Add flour reduce heat to medium-low and cook and stir constantly with a rubber spatula until mixture comes together and is smooth (a few lumps in it are fine).<br>
   <strong>Step 5:</strong> Transfer mixture to a large mixing bowl, let cool 5 minutes.<br>
   <strong>Step 6:</strong> Add vanilla and egg to flour mixture then blend immediately with an electric mixer. Blend until mixture comes together and is smooth (it will separate at first but keep mixing it will come together).<br>
   <strong>Step 7:</strong> Transfer to a 16-inch piping bag fitted with a rounded star tip (no bigger than 1/2-inch). I recommend using the Ateco 845 or 846.<br>
   <strong>Step 8:</strong> Carefully pipe mixture into preheated oil, into about 6-inch lengths, cut end with clean scissors.<br>
   <strong>Step 9:</strong> Let fry until golden brown, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to paper towels to dry briefly then transfer to cinnamon sugar mixture and roll to coat.<br>
   <strong>Step 10:</strong> Repeat process with remaining dough (frying no more than 5 at once). Serve warm with chocolate ganache or caramel sauce for dipping if desired.<br>
